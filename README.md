Angular-MovieHunter-WebAPI
==========================

Sample beginner Angular application using NancyFx for the Web API.

Since I'm using Xamarin and it don't support Websites Projects and just one simultaneous debug in a instance, I've splited the projects for using in separated Xamarin's instances. 

If you use Xamarin and want to run multiple instances, don't forget to check this out:
